# Basic-Transient-PDEs
This is a repo I created to understand better the numerical solution to transient PDEs in 1-D and 2-D. An attempt is made to make the codes self-explanatory. Numerical schemes explored will be Upwind, Lax-wendroff, Leapfrog, WENO and much more. Stay tuned! 
# 1-D advection: Upwind
