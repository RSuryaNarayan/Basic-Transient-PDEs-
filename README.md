# Basic-Transient-PDEs
This is a repo I created to understand better the numerical solution to transient PDEs in 1-D and 2-D. An attempt is made to make the codes self-explanatory. Numerical schemes explored will be Upwind, Lax-wendroff, Leapfrog, WENO and much more. Stay tuned! 
# 1-D advection: Upwind 
A coarse mesh gave the following result. Note that there is a damping of the amplitude if the mesh isn't fine enough. Try increasing the `mesh_u` parameter in the code and you can see the wave simply move forward without any damping the amplitude. This is explained in terms of the Courant number or the CFL (Courant Freidrich Lewy) number, which must always be less than 1 for a non-amplified solution. Its wise to re-compute the timestep by fixing a CFL in contrast to what's being done in the code. As the CFL is reduced, the solution gets more dissipated. Hence, finer meshes (as long as the CFL<1), so to speak, produce better results.
